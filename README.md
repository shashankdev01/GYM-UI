# GYM-UI
GYM-UI is usually made for user interface project 
This application was created with the purpose to solve the problem posed by our client gym company "Average Joes", who wishes to have a platform where both membership holders and staff can manage individual workouts, classes and gym environment. We therefore created an application that is separate from their home website that is exclusive to registered Average Joes membership holders and staff. The application is a helper tool for the gym that can be used on top of their original management system, that enhances the cutomer experience at their facility. Average Joes gym members can utilise this application to save and create their workout routines, keep track of their progress with certain exercises and book training sessions that are available at the gym. The application can further be used to optimise the gym's customer service by allowing users to submit reports in which staff members can smoothly handle.

The application also aims to enhances staff work efficiency by creating a platform where their schedules including upcoming personal training and classes can created and neatly organised.

With the launch and integration of this application, the client should see:

An increase in efficiency and streamlining of gym operations requiring decreased direct staff assistance.
Improved, cohesive appointment system.
Higher customer satisfaction with members having optimised personalised workouts to achieve their desired fitness goals.
